This folder contains the documentaiton for the ‘hurricaneexposure’ package along with a shiny app that was written as a quick demonstration.  As you can see from the package functions and the vignette, this package has a number of interesting mapping functions which will explore when we discuss mapping.  For now, however, you need to make a shiny application that displays presents explores the data.  We will add maps to your shiny app later.  

Please submit your assignment on black board before class this coming Monday. Since this is just phase one of a multi-phase assignment, your submission will only be checked to make sure it runs.  If it doesn't, you'll be asked to fix it.
